# SOFTLIVRE benchmarks
## by henrique / softlivre.com.br

A collection of scripts I have used to test performance of different local Dell servers and VPNÂ´s.

Place your bets! Which language will run a simple script faster?

PHP, Python, C++, Java ?

In this project, i will be comparing the performance of different servers on different scenarios. Mostly intended for practice and study, not to be used as a reference of any kind.
